1 Coding of deaths by cause for the latest week is not yet complete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 For deaths registered from 1st January 2020, cause of death is coded to the ICD-10 classification using MUSE 5.5 software. Previous years were coded to IRIS 4.2.3, further information about the change in software is available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 Deaths involving COVID-19 have been included within weekly death registrations figures due to the pandemic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 Does not include deaths where age is either missing or not yet fully coded. For this reason counts of 'Persons', 'Males' and 'Females' may not sum to 'Total Deaths, all ages'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 Non-residents are included in the England and Wales total but not England and Wales seperately. For this reason counts for ""England"" and ""Wales"" may not sum to ""England and Wales"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6 These figures represent death registrations, there can be a delay between the date a death occurred and the date a death was registered. More information can be found in our impact of registration delays release. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7 Deaths at home are those at the usual residence of the deceased (according to the informant)‚ where this is not a communal establishment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   Care homes includes homes for the chronic sick; nursing homes; homes for people with mental health problems and non-NHS multi function sites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   Hospices include Sue Ryder Homes; Marie Curie Centres; oncology centres; voluntary hospice units; and palliative care centres.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   Other Communal Establishments include schools for people with learning disabilities; holiday homes and hotels; common lodging houses; aged persons’ accommodation; assessment centres; schools; convents and monasteries; nurses’ homes;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   university and college halls of residence; young offender institutions; secure training centres; detention centres; prisons and remand homes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   Elsewhere includes all places not covered above such as deaths on a motorway; at the beach; climbing a mountain; walking down the street; at the cinema; at a football match; while out shopping; or in someone else's home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
   This category also includes people who are pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8 These figures are calculated using the most up-to-date data we have available to get the most accurate estimates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9 We have made improvements in the way we code place of death estimates and therefore there may be difference between these and previously published estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
