"Weekly death figures provide provisional counts of the number of deaths registered in England and Wales for which data are available, and the number of deaths for which the underlying cause was coded to respiratory diseases as defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision (ICD-10). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From 31 March 2020 these figures also show the number of deaths involving coronavirus (COVID-19), based on any mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes and definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deaths occurring in England and Wales are registered on the General Register Office's Registration Online system (RON).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Daily extracts of death registration records from RON are processed on our database systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Provisional data on deaths registered in each week (ending on a Friday) are compiled at the end of the following week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bank Holidays could affect the number of registrations made within those weeks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The counts of deaths from specific conditons are updated with each weekly publication as the coding of the underlying cause is not always complete at the time of production.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For deaths registered from 1st January 2020, cause of death is coded to the ICD-10 classification using MUSE 5.5 software. Previous years were coded to IRIS 4.2.3, further information about the change in software is available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where there are the same values in categories in consecutive weeks, the counts have been checked and are made up of unique death registrations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figures for the latest week are based on boundaries as of February 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
